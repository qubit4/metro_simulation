Simple simulation of Prague metro (built with simulation framework SimPy).

Two trains are running in an endless loop in opposite directions on one metro line... In regular intervals passengers are coming to the metro (their start and destination chosen at random), waiting for the correct train, taking the train and travelling to their destination. All steps of this process are captured in the simulation's step-by-step overview. In the end, the statistics are provided for average waiting time, average travel time and number of passengers transported by particular trains.

User input: number of passengers, interval between appearance of new passengers, particular metro line and duration of simulation.
